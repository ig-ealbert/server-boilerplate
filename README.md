Looking to get started quickly with an Express or Fastify server?  Looking to compare the two options?  Here are example servers in Typescript for both!

## Installation

```
npm install
```

**Note**: Make sure you have the latest version of Node installed on your computer.  Fastify won't work with some older versions.

## Running

// Choose one
npm run express
